    "* __2.1__: [Newton's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) is a root finding method that uses linear approximation. In particular, we guess a solution $x_0$ of the equation $f(x)= 0$, compute the linear approximation of $f(x)$ at $x_0$ and then find the x-intercept of the linear approximation. The general scheme of Newton's method may be written as: \n",
    "$$ x_{n+1} = x_n - \\dfrac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} $$ for $n=0,1, 2, ...$. The computation is repeated until $f(x_n)$ is close enough to zero. More precisely, we test if $|f(x_n)|< \\epsilon$ , with $\\epsilon$ being a small number. Write a function that returns an approximation of a solution of  $f(x)=0$ by Newton's method. Make sure that your function prints out an array containing the approximations as a function of iterations. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* __2.2__: Let $f(x)= x^2- 9$. Using the function from Part 1, calculate an approximation for the solution of $f(x)=0$ using $x_0= 1000$ and $\\epsilon= 0.01$. Make a convergence plot of the approximate solution as a function of iteration. Make this plot a scatter plot with scales log linear (x axis linear, y axis logarithmic).\n",

    "* __2.3__: Create a Figure with two subplots, one next to the other. \n",
    "    * First plot: Plot the function $f(x)$ using `x=np.arange(0, 10)`. You should label where the solution to $f(x)=0$ is at, i.e. label the point $(3,0)$. Draw a horizontal line at $y =0$, you can use `plt.hlines()`.\n",
